[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/h1dkfy35en8de4w2?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/tstephansen/classifier)

### Summary

This application uses computer vision to classify documents. You will need to create a document type, set the minimum score for a document to be counted as a match, and then add criteria for the document type. To view the matches you can use the Test Classification tab. To classify documents use the Classify tab. This is by no means ready for production use but it can be used if you aren't worried about the program crashing and have patience.
